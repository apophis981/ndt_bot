Don’t like Leap Days? We could instead wait 28 years and insert a “Leap Week”.  Or 112 years and insert a “Leap Month”.
@TheKidKelch @Andrew__Carter FYI:  To most people, “leap” has usage connotation of getting ahead, rather than catching up.
According to Gregorian rules, only 1 in 4 century years is a leap year — the rarity of 2000’s leap day went largely unnoticed
The Leap Day is misnamed. We’re not leaping anywhere. The calendar is simply, and abruptly, catching up with Earth’s orbit
Born on a leap day? You’ve had 1/4 as many birthdays as the rest of us, but sorry, you’re not 1/4th as old.
Earth takes nearly 365 1/4 days to orbit the Sun. Bank the fraction. Every 4 years add a whole day back to the neediest month

In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, once again I felt isolated and inadequate for not understanding Wookiee-speak.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the energy in a Star is enough to destroy ten-thousand planets, not just a few here &amp; there.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, if you were to suck all of a star’s energy into your planet, your planet would vaporize.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens the TIE fighters made exactly the same sound in the vacuum of space as in planetary atmospheres
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8, a smooth rolling metal spherical ball, would have skidded uncontrollably on sand.

Not that anybody asked, but the Irresistible Force beats the Immovable Object — every time.
The @Bengals stadium isn’t oriented exactly North-South. And the field goal was 42-yds. Yielding a 1/3-in deflection, not 1/2
In the N. Hemisphere, Earth’s Coriolis force deflects airborne north-south projectiles to the right. About 1/2-in per 50 yds.
@krallas @BillNye Wind farms are no different from forests, or other heavily grown areas that sway in the wind.
Today's @Bengals winning OT field goal was likely enabled by a 1/3-in deflection to the right, caused by Earth’s Rotation.

@nathorne @MartianMovie You think it’s a spoiler, but actually, it’s not.
The @MartianMovie — where the protagonist survives not on Wit, Prayer, or Hope. but by “Sciencing the Shit" out of everything
The @MartianMovie may be the first SciFi blockbuster — ever —  in which nobody dies.

The @MartianMovie — where you experience Love, Hate, Envy, Anxiety, Pride, &amp; Heroism, all through the lens of science.
The @MartianMovie — where science, not human emotion, drives the plot’s Humor, Interpersonal Relations, Tension, &amp; Suspense.

At the (slow) rate the Moon is tidally locking Earth, the Sun will die before it succeeds — a more important concern for all.
Contrary to Pink Floyd's 1973 album-cover proclamation, there is no Dark Side of the Moon. A day there simply lasts a month.
Earth has already tidally locked the Moon, which is why it shows only one face to Earth - the “near” side.
The Moon’s Motivation: Luna is desperately trying to slow Earth’s rotation so that one Earth day eventually equals one Month.

@Lee7828: Universe begins with a vowel, but we say “A” not “An" Universe. U is pronounced “You” which begins with a consonant

Cool Fact: Helium was discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on Earth. Was thus named for Helios, the Greek Sun god.
Or maybe Cherubs are actually filled with Helium. But Helium wasn’t discovered until 1868, long after most Cherubs were drawn
Okay. You want chubby babies to fly for real?  Give 'em ten foot (3-meter) wing-spans, like Condors, which weigh the same.

Curious fact that those who never fail are also those who never truly succeed.
For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A, and its radius is Z, and pi is just PI, then its volume is V = PIZZA.
In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area.
If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there
A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie.
Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.

Not that anybody asked, but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are "of the Sun" you are simply “Solar”.
Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - “of Venus” to all related diseases
Ceres is the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, which indeed gives us our breakfast word Cereal --  "of Ceres".
Gotta give you that one @elakdawalla.  If you’re from the Dwarf Planet Ceres, you’d surely be Cereal. https://t.co/e5SiAycXvD
From Venus? Then you’re Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did
And it seems to me that any life forms we discover within Jupiter’s icy moon Europa would rightly be called Europeans.
Seems to me, if we discover any life forms from the Vega star system (constellation Lyrae) they'd rightly be called Vegans.

Got a bunch more Southern Hemisphere tidbits, but I think I’ll save them for even later...
So “Alpha" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And “Beta" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor.
Apart from common names, stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the Greek alphabet.
The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed “Alpha Centauri”  The 3rd brightest in the night sky.
Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North, that of course coincides with our winter.
Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe.
Just an FYI: Earth’s South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. That’s why the North tip of a compass needle points there.
The center of the Milky Way — a target of study for my PhD — passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes.
“Arctic" derives from Arktos, the Greek word for Bear. The Arctic's got em. (For now.) The Ant-Arctic doesn't.
What’s the North Pole? Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation. Stick out your thumb. That’s North.

@Stompn_Tom: Last I checked Pittsburgh is in the Northern Hemisphere &amp; has many free Penguins. // Human Penguins don’t count.
Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there, they would reckon time backwards.
In the North, the shadow of a sundial’s gnomon sweeps clockwise. That’s, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place.
Some of us in the North are jealous that 100% of the world’s population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.
@arrowsails Yes.
Earth is not only oblate — wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped — slightly wider just south of the equator
Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than they’d weigh at the poles.
At a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is Earth’s fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly.
I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name "Equator". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador
Antarctica’s subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasn’t seen air in at least 15-million years.
The flag in Antarctica that ID's the South Pole has to be repositioned  every year. The glacier beneath moves continuously.
The South Pole is covered with land: Antarctica. In the North, Santa’s gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice
At about 2800 meters above sea level, the South Pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of Mount Olympus.
Toilet Bowls drain however they're designed to circulate water.  It’s irrelevant whether you live above or below the equator.

@esjabe If all cars aligned west-to-east &amp; floored it, would there be enough torque to slow Earth’s rotation? // Yes.

HOWEVER: If you melt all the land ice &amp; glaciers, especially Greenland &amp; Antarctica, Statue of Liberty would be waist deep.
And while we’re there: If all the Arctic Ocean’s floating ice &amp; icebergs melted, Earth’s sea level would remain unchanged.
You can’t compress ice. If you try, it instantly liquefies to occupy less volume, as under the hi-pressure of a skate blade.
As anybody who freezes food knows, water becoming ice expands by about 10%. Also why 10% of an iceberg sits above the water.
Obscure Fact: Skating is possible only because compressed ice melts. So skaters glide on slippery water not on slippery ice.

Supersonic planes can fly east-west fast enough to reverse Sunsets, landing at a clock time earlier than when they took off.

Thought Experiment: Stand on a scale in an elevator. Cut the cable. You, the scale, and the elevator fall -- scale reads zero
Cool Experiment: Poke a hole anywhere in a paper cup of water. Drop cup. Water, while weightless in free fall, stops spewing.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Astronaut Clooney informs medical doctor Bullock what happens medically during oxygen deprivation.
An Orbit is a continual state of free fall, but while moving so fast sideways that the surface curves away at the same rate.
Fall towards Earth. Fall towards the Moon. Fall towards Mars. Fall towards anywhere at all, you'll be weightless in zero-G
Earth's gravity extends to infinity. To experience "zero-G" simply requires you move through space without rockets firing.
My Tweets hardly ever convey opinion. Mostly perspectives on the world. But if you must know, I enjoyed #Gravity very much.
FYI: Angular Momentum -- The tendency, once set rotating, to keep rotating, unless another force acts to slow or stop it.

Mysteries of #Gravity: Satellite communications were disrupted at 230 mi up, but communications satellites orbit 100x higher.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Nearly all satellites orbit Earth west to east yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why Bullock's hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why anyone is impressed with a zero-G film 45 years after being impressed with "2001:A Space Odyssey"
Mysteries of #Gravity: When Clooney releases Bullock's tether, he drifts away. In zero-G a single tug brings them together.
Mysteries of #Gravity: How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) &amp; a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another.
Mysteries of #Gravity:  Why Bullock, a medical Doctor, is servicing the Hubble Space Telescope.

Are you a Tide weenie? I wrote an essay called "The Tidal Force" some years ago:  [2,000 words] http://t.co/EVUodTrfCu
Not only is Earth's rotation slowly slowing down, but the Moon's orbit is spiraling away from us by about 2-inches per year.
And not to disturb anybody, but Tides cause friction between Earth's crust and the sloshing oceans, slowing down our rotation
The Sun's tides are only about 1/3 that of the Moon's, so even during the canceling quarter phases, some Moon-tide remains.
During half-moons (1st &amp; 3rd quarter), the Lunar &amp; Solar tides add out of phase, partly canceling one another.
The tides during Full (and New) Moon are highest **only** because that's when the Sun's tides add directly to them.
While we're on the subject: The Moon's capacity to raise tides on Earth is no greater when Full than at any other phase.
Submitted without further comment. http://t.co/dX9rRQPLsE
FYI:Moon's orbit around Earth is oval. Distance varies by about 10%. When Moon is Full &amp; "close", some call it the Super Moon
The perennially hyped name "Super Moon" insults the legacy of Superman, Super Volcanoes, Supernovae, and even Super Mario.
Okay to call tonight's Full Moon "super", but only if you would call a 13-inch pizza "super" compared with a 12-inch pizza.

Hmm. Were it up to Princeton Review covers, my daughter would've never taken AP Calculus or Physics http://t.co/OzKP3SmF
In my asteroid-state-of-mind, I instead watched the 1998 film Deep Impact, where a Black president inherits a bad situation.
Was ready to watch the 1998 film Armageddon (in which the laws of physics are optional) but it's nowhere on Netflix or iTunes
One twentieth of one percent:  The fraction of NASA's budget allocated to locating Killer Asteroids.
One half of one percent:  The fraction of the US Federal Budget allocated to all of NASA's activities.
In the film Armageddon, a takeaway line was "No More Taxes!"  But taxes are what funded the NASA mission that saved the world
Of course in the 1998 film Armageddon, the asteroid chunks had awesome aim, hitting **all** the great cities of the world.
If NASA never deflects #2012DA14 and it hits Earth one day, we'll confirm that humans possess a lethal absence of foresight.
Finally, evidence for Hollywood that not all asteroids hit major cities of the United States.
If Asteroid #2012DA14 ever made it through Earth's atmosphere, its crater would be larger than Monaco.
We've known since the atom bombs over Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki, that air blasts can damage much wider areas than ground blasts.
The day Asteroid #2012DA14 hits Earth it will likely explode in our atmosphere, with 1000x the power of Hiroshima atomic bomb
LOOK--&gt;  From @BadAstronomer: LIVE video feed of #2012DA14 from Australia, and it’s way cool right now. http://t.co/esERhFg9
A thousand injured Russians agree: http://t.co/6P2EmPv3
Yup. Asteroid "2012 DA14" has an orbit that crosses Earth's orbit. It will one day hit us, like the one in Russian last night
Nope. Asteroid 2012DA14 won't redirect Earth's orbit any more than a gnat flying full speed ahead will topple a Bull Elephant
Yup. Asteroid "2012 DA14" buzz-cuts Earth today at a distance 5,000 miles closer than our orbiting communication satellites.
Yup. Asteroid "2012 DA14" is the size of a fifteen story office building.

Beyoncé radiates about 500 Watts, is my guess. But to be certain, I'd have to run a special calculation just for her.

Two professional sports teams named after numbers: SF 49ers &amp; Phila 76ers, each commonly abbreviated to its ones-place digit.
A millennium ago, Baghdad scholars adopted Zero, completing the system of ArabicNumerals used worldover, except in SuperBowls
Zero was invented after Roman Numerals and the Julian Calendar. That's why there was never a year Zero between BC and AD.
SuperBowl's have always used Roman Numerals to count. Good thing they don't score that way: there's no Roman Numeral for Zero
Odd that Football is named for a body part that rarely touches the ball. Can't call it Handball. I vote for Armball.

How many field goals in N/S stadiums flick the right upright's inside edge &amp; bounce backwards? Blame them on Earth's rotation
Coriolis force in N/S football stadiums always deflects field goals to the right: East for North kicks &amp; West for South kicks
Oops, @dopplershift noted that my Coriolis deflection was computed for the S. Hemisphere, where they don't play Am.Football.
@dopplershift Indeed, to the right. For reasons that defy explanation, I did the calculation for the S. Hemisphere. Will correct.
@bigalrosario: Does @neiltyson know these things? Or have to Google them? Either way I appreciate it. // I calculate them.
The Coriolis force comes from Earth's rotation, and it's what deflects clouds from North-South movement into circular storms.

Random Santa Fact: Another casualty of global warming -- as the poles melt, most would rather not see Santa in a bathing suit

@JerboMania: Wouldn't the atmosphere burn most of it? // No. You "burn" slowing from 17,000mph orbital speed, not by falling
@alexinfact: If ISS stopped orbiting Earth, would it fall to the surface? // Yes. Most parts would hit ground within 15 min.
@clayd0ugh: @neiltyson 4 astronauts died on the moon?!?  Why am I just now finding this out? // Four who have walked have died since.
@VeritasKnight: 24 went to the moon. (3 of them went twice.) // Yup. Thanks for that added fact.
@truthchief How many astronauts have been to the moon? // 27 went. Of those, 12 walked (6 also drove). Of those, 8 survive.

Full Moon today, 3:50pm ET. The Hunter's Moon -- the first after the Harvest Moon. See it tonight, if not smothered by Sandy.
As Hurricane Sandy passes by, If my electricity goes out, I guess I'll have to eat all the Ice Cream in my freezer.

Yup, it's 500 deg Celsius on Venus. But, yes, it's a dry heat.
@maarten_peels: Why aren't Americans using SI? That just works better. // We are inching towards the metric system.
@staggaz32: What's that in Celsius? // Sorry to confuse the metric-literate world out there. 900 deg F is about 500 deg C.
@dwc462: Why would you vaporize on Venus? // It's 900deg F, from a thick CO2 atmosphere driving a runaway greenhouse effect.
I suppose I'd still rather live on Earth, dodging storms &amp; risking extinction, than live on Venus, where I'd simply vaporize.
FYI: Earth has always been supremely hostile to life. That's why more than 95% of all species that ever lived are now extinct

Dear @MarsCuriosity, Neil deGrasse Tyson signing out on Earth. Back to work - for us both. Closing my Twitterverse wormhole to Mars.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, As for your complicated landing on Mars Sunday night 10:30pm PT -- do not try, do.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, We've got the #Olympics back here on Earth. But many of us will be focussed on you and your landing. Do us proud.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What are your instructions if a Martian crawls onto your back and rides you like a Rodeo Bull?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Bummer. You travel through space at seven miles per second, only to drive around on Mars at 1.5 inches per second.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, You're the size of an SUV, but with six wheels. What's the fastest that you can move?
Dear @MarsCuriosity,  After you land on Mars, what's your life expectancy?  (I hope somebody alerted you that we're not bringing you back.)
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Scientists conceived you, engineers designed you. But seriously, who do you like better, Scientists or Engineers?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What's your favorite experiment that you will conduct on Mars? Or is that like picking your favorite child?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, How autonomous are you? When you get to Mars can you just go six-wheeling around as you please?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Did you enjoy long periods of silence while travelling through space, or was JPL always trying to talk to you?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, So you're being subjected to ionizing radiation from space?  You're not only a robot, you're a guinea pig.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, You've been traveling for nine months. How did you pass your time? Did they let you play "Angry Birds Space"?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Wait a minute. You travelled a 100-million miles in space &amp; hit an area 12x4 miles? Cool. Way better than a hole-in-one
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Are all your parts working as they should? Anything you're not telling us back here on Earth? (I won't tell JPL.)
Dear @MarsCuriosity, You call EDL 7-minutes of terror. Sure, to you. But to us on Earth, it's 7 minutes + 15 minutes signal time.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What's the size of your landing spot on Mars? Is it small? It's a whole planet, I'd be happy just to land anywhere.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, just as I suspected. An element named after Pluto. Discovered when everyone thought the little iceball was a planet.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What exactly is giving power to your Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, How does it feel out there as you near planet Mars?  Are you Cold? Hot? Or just right?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Neil deGrasse Tyson here on Earth, tweeting you, via a wormhole, through deep space.  Do you copy?
The day we stop exploring is the day we commit ourselves to live in a stagnant world, devoid of curiosity, empty of dreams.

Weightlifters, whose sole job is to raise barbells from planets that attracts them, on Mars achieve 2.6x their personal bests
Gymnastics: On Mars, with only 38% of Earth's gravity, the Vault &amp; other spring-assisted leaps would resemble circus cannons.
Women's BeachVolleyball on Mars: No protective ozone layer there. Solar UV would irradiate all exposed legs, buns, &amp; tummies
Rowing on Mars would log about the same race times. There's hardly any movement with or against the 62% lower gravity there.
With 1% of Earth's air density, Badminton on Mars would be different -- a shuttlecock to the face lands you in the hospital.
Like to Kayak white waters? Valles Marineris on Mars is nearly 10x the length of Arizona's Grand Canyon.
If there was Cycling on Mars, try Olympus Mons -- a volcanic mountain 5x taller than Mont Blanc in the Alps.
If there was Swimming on Mars, the low temperature &amp; low air pressure would force the pool to simultaneously freeze &amp; boil.
How about a Mars #Olympics? Yes, all athletes would suffocate. Ignoring that complication -- way cooler than Earth #Olympics.

Careful observation reveals that players &amp; coaches of 3hr Baseball games spit at least 6-gal (24 liters) of saliva onto field
Hand-stitched balls, rubbing mud, leather mitts, wooden bats, pine tar. Baseball: a game untouched by modern materials.
FYI: Laws of physics show that it takes twice as much energy to throw a baseball 100 mph than it does to throw one at 70 mph.
About that slow pitch: BugsBunny can throw a slower one. He's subject instead to Cartoon Laws of Physics http://t.co/4PxPmGTg
Slowest pitch in Baseball to reach catcher? 30 mph, thrown at 45-deg angle. Any slower and at any other angle hits the ground
Does it disturb anyone else that "The Los Angeles Angels" baseball team translates directly to "The The Angels Angels"?
Curious that intent is assigned by announcers when a batter gets a hit. Yet 70% of the time the player can't get a hit at all
@AllStarGame: Baseball is ideal for talking &amp; tweeting &amp; tracking stats. Only 30-min of actual playing time in a 3-hr game.
Never figured why the Foul Pole is called the Foul Pole when it's entirely in fair territory. Should be called the Fair Pole.
Baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank, and then credit against errors they might later commit.
In Baseball, if a pitch hits you on ball four, you should get to advance to second base.
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate &amp; if you don't care about curve balls.
If baseball reported averages to 4 decimal places instead of 3, then a three-hundred hitter would be batting "three thousand"
In the 1960s, when we still dreamed, we named a dome, a baseball team, and even the artificial turf they played on "Astro"

We could, in principle, re-define the length of the second each time. Instead, we wait until one accumulates and add it whole
A Bar-bet you can win tonight:  Today's Leap Second makes June 30, 2012 the longest 24-hour day of the year.

Wouldn't it be cool if, right about now, silhouettes of spaceships were seen escaping Venus, visible against the glowing Sun.
Space Shuttle Endeavour, soon to rest at the Cal Sci Center, was named for Captain Cook's ship - hence the British spelling.
Captain Cook saw the June 3, 1769 Venus Transit from South Pacific, also mapping islands there for later British colonization
Venus Transit is historically significant because you can derive the solar system's size from precision timing of the event.
In the era of the Telescope, there's been 258 Total Solar Eclipses but only eight Venus Transits, including today's.
Venus transits are long &amp; boring -- but rare. Every 110 years, or so, they typically come in pairs, separated by eight years.
Kepler Telescope looks for similar brightness drops in search of exoplanets crossing our lines of sight to their host stars.
Later today, for nearly six hours, sunlight we receive dims by 0.1% as Venus crosses Earth's line of sight to the Sun.

From a rainbow, GREEN is Roy G. Biv's middle name. Red Orange Yellow GREEN Blue Indigo Violet.
The "GREEN" movement might be misnamed. Experiments show increased CO2 promotes photosynthesis, making plants grow faster.
The "GREENFlash" is not a superhero but a rare spectral phenomenon of setting Sun. Best viewed at sea thru a calm atmosphere.
The Hulk is GREEN from a potent, accidental dose of Gamma Rays. Actually, he would have died within weeks from organ failure.
Our eyes are about 10x more sensitive to GREEN light than Red. So watt-for-watt GREEN lasers look much brighter than Red ones
By the 1920s the GREEN-emitting element nebulium was ID'ed as oxygen, but behaving oddly in the rarefied conditions of space.
Mid-19th century, a mysterious element was discovered in galactic nebulae. It emanated deep GREEN. Dubbed "nebulium"
The peak sensitivity of the Human Retina is GREEN, matching the peak spectral output of the Sun.
The Sun emits more GREEN light than any other band of light in the rainbow.
Curiously, light-loving GREEN plants reject the Sun's GREEN light, reflecting it back at you, which is why they look GREEN.
The laws of physics conspire to prevent GREEN stars in the universe. They basically come in three colors: Red, White, &amp; Blue.
A cosmic romance on the color GREEN follows shortly…

On this eve a visual seduction. Astrofolk call it a TripleConjunction. In twilight's rune Jupiter&Venus flank a crescent Moon
Tons of tweets to come this week. Brace yourself...
Decided to buy @SamHarrisOrg's latest book, where he argues FreeWill is an illusion. So I guess I had no choice in the matter
In twilight this night -- don't miss this show -- find Jupiter, Venus and a  thin crescent Moon, all in a row.
@GeekyHuman The Reddit session on the Moon that's currently unfolding looks like it's getting along just fine without me.
@ETBoggs How do I prep for doomsday, you ask? Not by fleeing w/toilet paper, but by seeking SciTech solutions to prevent it.
Look hiigh in the west, after the Sun has set, planet Venus shines bright, like an airplane's light.
Feb 20, 1962, The USA launches John Glenn into Earth orbit. Something America could do fifty years ago….but not today.
Feb 20, 1962: USA launches John Glenn into orbit. He followed Russian Dogs, GuineaPigs, Mice, a cosmonaut & an American chimp
For early risers, this Sunday morn, a  thin crescent Moon greets the light of dawn.
@rahim_in_to Can Liquid H2O get hotter than 100 C, you ask? Yup, when under pressure. Temps at undersea hot vents reach 400 C
I may have in me one more Reddit "Ask Me Anything" session, completing a trilogy. Later in February. Will Tweet notice of it.
A Loss of Science Literacy: Not long ago those who agreed were "on the same wavelength." But today they're "on the same page"
Whenever the Twitterverse calls, and the Spirit of Science moves me, I feel compelled to Textify.
@Btwestonsf: GOP tends to be better for NASA. So do you favor them over Obama, you ask? I've never been a one-issue voter.
Never liked multiple choice tests. They don't allow you to have deeper thoughts than those of the person who wrote the test.

@JTWhelan2011 How do BlackHoles remember everything they've ever eaten, you ask? One of the spookier facts of QuantumPhysics
@rebeccamarino Do I have any insight on star real estate? Yup. The Sun is hot. So you'll have to travel there at night.
@rebeccamarino Do I have any insight on star real estate?  Yup. On the Sun you'll vaporize -- location, location, location.
@MarsTravel Who will land men on the Moon first, the Gov't or Private companies, you ask? At our current rate, China.
@mahujedi Does FullMoon affect people's behavior, you ask? Yup. It makes people think the FullMoon affects people's behavior
@zacharEdimond Can you promise a big asteroid won't kill me & my dog? Yup. If you die from an asteroid it'll be a small one.
@LeapOfAwesome Most important area of science today? All of them. And it's their cross-pollination that breeds innovation.
@mathteacher1729 Concerned about scientifically illiterate elected officials? Not their fault. Blame who voted for them.
@EdWelshSays Why Leap Seconds?  Fun to add. But of no consequence to daily life. I'm happy to wait 'til they sum to an hour.
@MilesCurry Why increase funding for space exploration, you ask?  There is no greater force on ambition than NASA's vision
@KjWick What effect will NASA's future have on science education. EVERYTHING.  More people need to be convinced of that fact
@tep620 Why are adults more superstitious than children, you ask? They need something to blame when things go wrong.

"The Physics of Football" featuring three NY Giants players. From the @StarTalkRadio archives: http://t.co/3etK6jzg
SuperBowl Coke commercial showed (Arctic) Polar Bears co-existing with (Antarctic) Penguins. Not artistic license. Ignorance.
I think the winner of the Super Bowl should play the winner of the Pro Bowl in a final game called the SuperDuper Bowl.
Momentum Transfer. Elastic & Inelastic Collisions.  Spin-stabilized projectiles. Nothing like Physics & Football.
Truth in Sports Mantras:  Indeed, there's no 'I" in TEAM.  But there is, in fact, a "ME" and no trace of a "WE".
Another casualty of global warming: as the poles melt, most would rather not see Santa in a bathing suit.
Television ownership in America households = 97%.  Americans who live below the poverty level = 15%
FYI:  1991: 27-inch RCA Television = $800.   2012: 43-inch Samsung Plasma Flat panel = $500
I'd bet there's nobody left in America whose home flat panel TV isn't bigger than the ones in their local Sports Bar.

Just an FYI: Appearing tonight with Brian Williams on @RockCenterNBC -- 10pm ET / PT. More on Moon colonies. Be there.
@schierholz You're leaving NASA? Now we'll never get to Mars. Or if we do, nobody will know about it.
@arielllle: Where can you stand on top of the world, you ask? Right where you are, with all of Earth beneath your feet.
Of my MSNBC review of Newt's Moon colony, Conservative press says I "Sympathize" with it. Liberal press says I "Shot it Down"
The "eenie-meenie-minie-moe" rhyme is evenly divisible. So if choosing between two, start on the one you secretly don't want.
There again this eve -- not a moment too soon. Pinned on twilight's curtain find Jupiter & Venus, in line with the Moon.
@gnice3d Do FatBottom Girls Make the RockingWorld go Round, you ask? Not quite. It's angular momentum from Earth's formation
As darkness falls on this night, dusk offers Venus shining bright. Crescent Moon's there too, with Jupiter, high and in view.

REALITY CHECK: The biological logistics of Noah's Ark: http://t.co/OxblcWYW
Area of a pizza (or any circle), is pi times radius squared. Volume of a pizza (or any cylinder) is the Area times the depth.
Of course the volume of that pizza is: V = pi zz a   “@Maz_Man_Utd: what about pizza volume if radius = z and thickness = a?”
A 14 inch diameter gets you 154 square inches; a 10 inch gives 78 square inches; and a 7 inch, 38 square inches - of Pizza pi
If Pizza sizes were given in area not diameter, you'd see instantly that a 7 inch is less than half the size of a 10 inch pie

@andrewcookie93 Want to prolong sunset at the NorthPole? Just sit there on the Fall Equinox. The Sun takes 27 hours to set
@andrewcookie93 Want to stop sunset along the equator? Fly east to west about 1000 mph. But our planes don't fly that fast.
@andrewcookie93 Can you fly a plane toward sunset and see it perpetually, you ask? Sure. NY to LA at 800 mph will do it.
ThisJust In: A LeapSecond will be added to the last minute of June 30, 2012 to account for Earth's ever-slowing rotation rate
In 5-billion yrs the Sun will expand & engulf our orbit as the charred ember that was once Earth vaporizes. Have a nice day.
Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun is stable. And the size of the Sun is stable…for now.
@RickFerrino How fast does Earth approach the Sun, you ask? From July-Jan, 700mph on average. Recedes during other 6 months.

@ShockingWisdom Please cite material to justify the assumptions of your question and I'll be happy to reply.
Earth's (remaining) glaciers & cloud cover greatly boost our reflectivity. The Moon is about as reflective as tire-rubber.
In case you were curious: being larger & more reflective, full Earth on the Moon is 40x brighter than full Moon on Earth.
Just an FYI: Crossing the sky at much higher angles, winter full Moons appear, on average, brighter than summer full Moons.
This January eve, in a line across the sky, find Venus in twilight, moonrise in the east, and Jupiter up on high.
The full Moon of tomorrow, and the gibbous Moon of this night, will grace our skies, dusk to dawn, in soft, majestic light.
Winter full moons, living opposite the Sun, cross high in the sky, after daylight is done

@MartyKay86 A true statement, whether or not I said it.  But the quote is close enough. Perhaps from this talk: bit.ly/x0fw4G
@bccxcc Yes, the atom-count in the observable universe is known. How about photons, you ask? Two billion times that number.
@bdsams Does Earth weigh more today than yesterday, you ask? Yup. We plow thru several hundred tons of meteor dust per day.
@HunsV When is the Soylent Green scenario, you ask? Eating your own species for sole sustenance leads to rapid extinction.
No agreement on what Earth pop. will be stable, but Leeuwenhoek's original 1679 estimate of 14B continues to fall in middle.
@kingoftv Wouldn't it require @LadyGaga 's new followers to end, you ask? Yes. Earth's population may stabilize at 14billion
Thank you @joelvictoriano. You're my 300,000th follower. At this rate, in another 38,000 years, I'll catch up with @LadyGaga.

Laika is surely the toast of Dog heaven. Right there next to Lassie, Balto, Rin Tin Tin, and of course, Spuds MacKenzie.
@MrTinDC Sad that Laika died in space? If you gotta go, better to die there than in a Moscow alley - hungry & cold.
@boring_as_heck Can I get you Laika's autograph, you ask? No. The Moscow mutt, died in orbit & vaporized on re-entry in 1957
So, contrary to popular suspicion, seasons have nothing whatsoever to do with Earth's slowly varying distance from the Sun.
But In July, Earth's Sun-tipped axis gives N. Hemisphere's middle latitudes a factor of 5x more sunlight than in January.
During its January close-approach to the Sun, Earth receives about 7% more sunlight than it does during July's far-approach.
Merry Perihelion: Tonight, Earth passes closer to the Sun than any other time during its annual oval-shaped orbit.

Yes, @Asylum31. Geologists and globe makers have been misleading school children for centuries.
@Asylum31 How big must a globe be for the raised mountains to be proportionally correct, you ask?  About forty feet across.

Earth's Coriolis force - in which low latitudes speed around Earth's axis faster than high latitudes - drives all hurricanes.
In N/S stadiums, the Coriolis force deflects a football to the right for a North kick and to the left for a South kick.

@boring_as_heck Re-post your best question from 2011 and I'll see what I can do.
Wow. I can remember the year 2011 as though it were yesterday.
FYI:NewYear celebrations begin 6hr too early per yr, relative to Earth's orbital return spot. The 4yr leapday corrects for it
Odd that we mark the New Year's exact moment - a fresh Earth orbit - yet celebrate it one time zone after another, 24 times
Geek Heaven -- New Year's Eve: Two marathons, one night -- SyFy channel's "Twilight Zone" and TBS's "The Big Bang Theory".
@jbg7 Concerned about which way "up" really is? "Up" is every direction away from Earth's center. That's the entire cosmos.
As 2011 draws to a close, I remind us all that in life and in the universe, it is always best to keep looking up.
Good to see Apollo 11's Buzz Aldrin in a cameo spot. Yes, long ago, in a country that once was, astronauts visited the Moon.
In any case, in Transformers III, it was good to see Optimus Prime kicking bot.
Transformers III was 45m too long. There's no Dark Side of the Moon. And Apollo 11's Lunar Module was still on its launch pad
Just caught up with Transformers III. The bots tear up Chicago. About time an action film destroys a city other than New York

Can you see the whole Moon in the arm's of the crescent? It's sunlight bounced off full-Earth, then the Moon, then back to us
After Venus and the Moon sink low in the west, look south and high, for Jupiter at its best.
Stunning thin crescent moon joins Venus this night, look low in the west during evening's twilight.
10 tweets in 1 day. Last did that for a shuttle launch. Please don't come to expect it. My preferred rate is a few per week.
...and why during sunset, when light passes through the most atmospheric crud, the Sun looks deep red & the sky, deep violet.
That's also why the daytime Sun looks yellow-ish and the surrounding sky looks "sky" blue.
And that's why a car (or truck's) fog lights are amber -- a color that penetrates the fog to illuminate the road.
That's why a car's blueish high-beams are useless in fog - light scatters within to offer an excellent view of the fog itself
Long wavelength red-orange part of the spectrum passes thru fog/dust/pollen while short wavelength blue-violet gets scattered
Newton showed that white light (like sunlight) is composed of a rainbow of colors: Red-Orange-Yellow-Green-Blue-Violet.
Some unfinished business regarding Rudolph's nose -- in six tweets...
@rna11y You want to celebrate Newton's b'day Dec 25 (1642)? He was born Jan 4, 1643, on the Gregorian calendar in use today.
I suppose the Christmas carol lyric "Go, Tell It On The Mountain, Over the hills & everywhere" would today be "Send a Tweet"
Christians: MerryChristmas; Jews & Muslims: HappySunday; Atheists & Agnostics: HappyDay359 (Days of week are named for gods)
Red light cuts thru fog better than white. So if Rudolph's nose did glow he'd indeed prevent Santa from flying into mountains
Nope. I'm cool with the flying reindeer. RT @sarnoski: That's what get you? Not the flying reindeer?
According to the song, Rudolph's nose is shiny, which means it reflects rather than emits light. Useless for navigating fog.
Seems that by now, given Santa's body weight & shape, hungry PolarBears would have mistaken him for a seal and eaten him.
FYI: As the world warms & the Arctic melts, the PolarBear is not the only one to lose a habitat. Santa also gets cast adrift.
@SethMacFarlane Speaking of Superman, if he's really made of indestructible stuff, seems to me he wouldn't need big muscles.

Some elements don't interact with others. NobleGases the Brits called them, tainting the PeriodicTable with their ClassSystem
Scientists in the Elements:  Curium Bohrium Lawrencium Einsteinium Fermium Seaborgium Rutherfordium Meitnerium & Copernicium
The "big" asteroids Ceres and Pallas each have elements in their honor as well:  cerium & palladium.
Pluto got an element named after it -- plutonium -- on false pretense.
More cosmic objects: Uranus (uranium), Neptune (neptunium), Pluto (plutonium) -- appearing in sequence on the Periodic Table.
Cosmic objects with elements named in their honor:   Sun (helium), Mercury (mercury), Earth (telerium), Moon (selenium)
An element was discovered in the Sun before it was found on Earth. Named in honor of the Greek sun god Helios: "Helium"
Gotta love the Periodic Table of the Elements - that mysterious chart of boxes that hung in your High School chemistry class.
Finally: Gen. Assembly of International Union of Pure & Applied Physics officially named an element (No.112) after Copernicus
Since a meteor is space debris that burns as it falls toward Earth, the term Meteoric Fall is far more apt than Meteoric Rise

If baseball reported averages to four decimal places, instead of three, then a perfect hitter would be batting "ten thousand"
Just an FYI: It takes twice as much energy to throw a baseball 100mph than it does to throw one at 70mph. Do The Physics
The "ManagerOfTheYear" award should not be a vote, but should go to who gets the most wins per dollar of player salaries paid
On the Moon, with 1/6 of Earth's gravity, a 400 ft home run would travel nearly half a mile. Do the physics.
If you walk on 4 pitches it should count against the pitcher. But if you walk on 8 pitches, it should count as a hit.
RT @Will_Knight3: No. If you get hit, you get to pick up the ball & throw it back at the pitcher's head. Then go to 2nd base.
Baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank, and then credit against errors they might later commit.
New baseball rules I'd like to see: if the pitch that hits you is ball four, you should get to advance to second base.
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate & if you don't care about curve balls

Northerners who visit there praise southern skies not because the stars are better but because the skies are darker.
With less than 10% of Earth's light-polluting cities in S. Hemisphere, skies viewed from down under tend to stun northerners.
Southern Cross is surely misnamed.  Four stars only - a crooked square. Perhaps it should be called the "Southern Rhombus"

Many lament the end our 30-year Space Shuttle program. But is there any technology -- at all -- from 1981 that you still use?
Worried about privatization of access to Earth orbit? Overdue by decades. NASA needs to look beyond, where it belongs.

Congratulations to the National League. But at least a Yankee (Robinson Cano) won the Home Run derby last night.
If baseball reported averages to four decimal places, instead of three, then a perfect hitter would be batting "ten thousand"

5th grader at son's baseball game pitched 62mph. Figured it with stop watch. Got asked "Which app?" I replied "My brain app"
Curious that intent is assigned by announcers when a batter gets a hit. Yet 70% of the time the player can't get a hit at all
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate & if you don't care about curve balls.

Hand-stitched balls, rubbing mud, leather mitts, wooden bats, pine tar.  Baseball: a game untouched by modern materials.
After careful observation I note that players & coaches of 3hr baseball games spit at least six gallons of saliva onto field.
Slowest pitch in Baseball to reach catcher? 30mph, thrown at 45-deg angle. Any slower at any other angle hits ground.

Successful launch to orbit for Atlantis STS-135. Have a good day, Twitterverse. Thanks for sharing your slice of it with me.
11:29 am ET - Liftoff at the Cape.  Godspeed Atlantis astronauts.
Apollo in 1969. Shuttle in 1981. Nothing in 2011. Our space program would look awesome to anyone living backwards thru time.
Not much Grump left within me.  But perhaps I can eek out one more...
The entire half-century budget of NASA equals the current two year budget of the US military.
The US military spends as much in 23 days as NASA spends in a year - and that's when we're not fighting a war.
The US bank bailout exceeded the half-century lifetime budget of NASA.
NASA costs Americans half a penny on a tax dollar. That fraction of a bill is not wide enough from the edge to reach the ink.
Just an FYI: Human access to space doesn't end with the Shuttle era, only American access. China and Russia still go there.
When JFK committed America to land on the Moon, his projected date would have fallen under his watch as a 2-term President.
Obama promises a future of NASA with trips to Mars on a time frame that exceeds his tenure as a 2-term President.
If Earth were size of a school-room globe, our atmosphere wouldn't be much thicker than the coat of lacquer on its surface.
If Earth were size of a school-room globe, you'd find Shuttle and Space Station orbiting 3/8th of an inch above its surface.
If Earth were the size of a school-room globe, the Moon would be 30-ft away. Mars, more than a mile away.
Space Arithmetic:  Mercury + Gemini + Apollo = 10 years.  Shuttle = 30 years.
Many lament the shuttle era's end.  But it was boldly going where hundreds had gone before. Time to go new places.
FYI:  Commercial Space Flight will not advance the space frontier, but enable cheaper access to where we've already been.
Other than the waging of War, the ISS (assembled by Shuttle) is the most successful collaboration of nations there ever was.
No. I'm not in Florida for the launch today. I'm a much bigger fan of when things begin than of when they end.
A reminder that nobody lamented the end of Gemini because Apollo was set to launch from the pad next-door.
Many lament the shuttle era's end. But that's misplaced sentiment. Lament instead the absence of an era to replace it.
Shuttle mission in the film "Space Cowboys" was STS-200.  With the launch of Atlantis, the actual program reaches only STS-135
The inability to predict weather across 5- days is chaos. The inability to predict weather across 5-hours is ignorance.
@AdrianNeumann Weather is chaotic over five days, not five hours. Over five hours we're just ignorant.
Chance of storms delaying Shuttle Launch: 70%. Reminder that we comprehend weather only well enough to predict statistically.
@airman_dan Thanks for that error correction.  It's still early in the morning for me.  Will fix immediately.
@aschoks The SRBs point straight down. Left alone, the shuttle assembly would flip backwards. Angled nozzles prevent this.

Lobsters (and Vulcans) use copper instead of iron in their blood. Oxidized copper gives blue-green tinge.
Hmm. if we had copper instead of iron in our blood, turning it green, what color would we have made stoplights and stopsigns?

@briantroberts FYI: Summer solstice is not a day but a moment during the day, separating Spring from Summer.
Yup. One can never tire of the physics of light.
Time delay moves hottest time of day a few hrs after "high" noon & hottest time of yr a month or two after 1st day of summer.
So, Sun's visible light doesn't heat air, it heats ground. Ground then re-radiates IR, which heats the air - a little later.
Air is transparent to visible light, where Sun's energy peaks. That's why we can see the Sun & each other thru atmosphere.
Just an FYI: Counting hours of sunlight?  For every day of Summer there's a matching day in Spring w/ same hours of daylight.
@Dasher3d What do I mean by "shorter days" in summer, you ask? Length of daylight, of course. The 24hr day remains intact.

Welcome home Astronauts: 248orbits. 6,510,221mi; Well done Endeavour: 25missions. 4,671orbits. 123,883,151 miles on odometer.
Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle's landing strip is 15,000 feet long. Long enough for the brakeless Orbiter to coast to a stop.
The SpaceShuttle alone has no engines. Fuel tanks on launch were all rented. Below Mach-1 Endeavour lands as a simple glider.
For most of Endeavour's re-entry, it's a ballistic brick falling from the sky. Below the speed of sound, it's aerodynamic.
When moving faster than sound, forward directed waves pile atop one another, greatly magnifying their volume: A Sonic Boom.
I'm in good company RT @RealNichelle: Mine too! RT @neiltyson My favorite shuttle? ENTERPRISE. Named for Capt Kirk's starship
Protective Shuttle tiles reach thousands of degrees (F), persistently radiating heat away. Shielding the astronauts within.
Mostly buried, Chicxulub crater of the Yucatan Peninsula was made 65million yrs ago, leaving the world's dinosaurs extinct.
FYI:  On approach to its Florida runway, Endeavour will pass directly over the Chicxulub crater from the KT asteroid impact.
As Endeavour dips into Earth's atmosphere, the surrounding air heats up, whisking away the Shuttle's energy of motion.
@davidleyman Define a "scad" you ask?  Officially, it's more than a bunch, but less than a boatload.
As Endeavour's speed slows, it drops lower in Earth's atmosphere, encountering an ever-increasing density of air molecules.
Shuttle takes 1/2 of Earth's circumference to drop 200 miles out of the sky. Slowing from 17,200mph orbit to 220mph landing
Shuttle now executing a "de-orbit burn" dropping its path low enough to meet scads of motion-impeding air molecules.
Just an FYI: To land, Space Shuttle Endeavour must lose all the energy of motion that it gained during launch.
I look forward to the day when retired Space Shuttles become quaint reminders of how we used to access space.

Shuttle's orange fuel tank has 2 internal tanks. One for Hydrogen, 2x size as one for Oxygen, giving Energy plus H2O exhaust
Birds at the launch site are surely thinking to themselves:  "These humans have come a long way with their artificial wings"
6) "3 - 2 - 1 - Liftoff" -- SolidRocketBoosters ignite, tipping Shuttle straight upwards again. Bolts explode. Craft ascends
5) "Main Engine Start" -- Orbiter's 3 nozzles ignite, take aim, and force shuttle to tip forward. Bolts still hold her down.
4) Water Tower dumps a swimming-pool's worth onto the launch pad -- H2O absorbs sound vibrations, preventing damage to craft
3) Sparks spray onto launch pad -- they burn away any potentially flammable hydrogen gathered there from the main engine.
2) The Orbiter's 3 rocket nozzles gimbal to & fro -- a final reminder that they can aim the way they're supposed to.
1) Orbiter's steering flaps jiggle back and forth -- a final reminder that they can angle the way they're supposed to.
If camera-coverage enables, six cool things to look for just seconds before ignition of the SolidRocketBoosters...
Most of Shuttle's energy accelerates it horizontally rather than vertically. Go 17,200 mph sideways & you'd reach orbit too.
Most of the Shuttle's initial propulsion is to accelerate the mass of fuel that burns later in the launch.
@ia42 You ask for thrust units in metric tons rather than "American" tons?  They're about the same. Within 10% of each other
Endeavor gets 2.4million lbs of thrust **more** than its 4.4million lbs of weight, giving about 1/2 G acceleration on liftoff
Endeavor weighs 4.4million lbs. If engines gave only 4.4million lbs of thrust, forces would balance, leaving it afloat on pad
Would a NASA reality show "Lunar Shore" be more  popular than "Jersey Shore"?  Civilization"s future depends on that answer

What country do I live in? TimeWarnerCable @TWCable_NYC: 750 channels. (Dozens in foreign languages.)  None of them NASA-TV
Space Shuttle Endeavour launches this hour. Created to replace Challenger. Named for ship used by 18th c. explorer Capt. Cook
@BenSpearman You ask about time reckoning?  Day, Month, Year, have cosmic origins. All else derive culturally from them.
ClimateChange deniers are often politically conservative.Yet ensuring climate doesn't change is itself an act of conservatism

@schierholz Never grow tired of this view? http://yfrog.com/gz54wpjj I hope you do. It'll mean greater rockets will be in use
FYI: Monday I'm tweeting random, pointless information about @NASA 's launch of Shuttle Endeavour. Sched. liftoff: 8:56 am ET
@houseofsaad  What do I think of Carl Sagan, you ask? I said it best here, I think [1m 40s] http://youtu.be/imS6H1JAkGY
Received some lessons recently on how to pronounce French words. My summary, to first approximation: all letters are silent.
Just an FYI: Friday the 13th is just as common as Thursday the 12th.
In Seattle now. The Sun came out today and people reacted joyously.  Must be a rare event.

This night find the First Quarter moon. "Half Moon" to most. High in the sky at dusk, it sets at midnight, but rose at noon.
Difference between what we want to be true & what is actually true in the world is source of most human conflict & suffering.
On FX  today "Armageddon" followed by "TheDayAfterTomorrow."  An afternoon of movies where the laws of physics are optional.
@JohnAllenPaulos As listed, I think that would instead be Gregorian to Julian.
@cchillur Thanks for checking. I plan to create a web page with all my twitter math for people to follow-up.  Stay tuned.
@QuantumG  Thanks for your interest in my speeches. I offer a reply to your comments on your blog.

@Huckle_Cat You, of course, make an accurate legal distinction, but it makes no difference to the point of the Tweet.
Just an FYI: If scientists invented the legal system, eye witness testimony would be inadmissible evidence.
